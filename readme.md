# White Label E-Commerce App

This is a white label e-commerce app built with React Native and Expo. For this project I wanted to focus and practice on 2 main things:

First it utilises the 'NavigationContainer' from '@react-navigation', this is how the bottom tab navigation functions. It uses screens to switch between displays, these screens are selected using the bottom navigation.

Second I wanted to utilise the 'FlatList' component to display multiple automated carousels. These will scroll automatically, or can be swiped by the user. The carousels can be populated by JSON data which would be retrieved from an API.
